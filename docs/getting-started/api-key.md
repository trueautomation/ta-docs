# API Key

Each user who registered an account on [TrueAutomation.IO](https://app.trueautomation.io) receives an API key.

**The API key is needed to grant access to your TrueAutomation account. You have 2 options for authorize trueautomation client via setting up api-key.**
* to use the command `trueautomation api-key <API-KEY>`. (More info: [trueautomation commads](/client/commands.md#setting-api-key))

* when the first time you make a `trueautomation init`.

If the API key is not installed when you run the test, there is an error that tells you how to solve the problem:

!> API key is not set. Run `trueautomation init` to set the API key.

Now that you know about the API key, you can proceed [setting up your first TrueAutomation project](/getting-started/project-setup.md).
