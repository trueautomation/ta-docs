# API Key

Each user has his unique API key which is used to authorize access of TrueAutomation Client to your TrueAutomation.io account. You can find your API key under `My Profile` section as displayed below:

#### There are 2 options of adding your API key:

- Insert API key once you run `trueautomation init` command for the 1st time. As displayed below:

- Run `trueautomation api-key <API-KEY>` command. More info: [trueautomation commads](/client/commands.md#setting-api-key)

If your API key is not set, you will be getting an error message whenever you try to run tests.
