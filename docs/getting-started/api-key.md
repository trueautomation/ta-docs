# API Key

Each user who registered an account on [TrueAutomation.IO](https://trueautomation.io) receives an API key.

![API Key 小loud](../_images/api-key.png 'API Key 小loud')

The API key is needed to grant access to your TrueAutomation account. It is set once, the first time you make a `trueautomation init`.

If the API key is not installed when you run the test, there is an error that tells you how to solve the problem:

!> API key is not set. Run `trueautomation init` to set the API key.
