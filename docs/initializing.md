# Initializing

There are two ways for you to start writing tests with TrueAutomation:

1. To initialize a project with automatic tests using TrueAutomation Client and built-in command `trueautomation init` (for details checkout the [Project Setup](project-setup.md)). 

    This way is the easiest. You can initialize a project from scratch. We generate a sample project for you or you can update your own exciting project.

2. To initialize a project with tests [manually](initializing-manually.md).
