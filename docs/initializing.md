# Initializing

There are two ways for you to start writing tests with TrueAutomation:

* To initialize a project with automatic tests using TrueAutomation Client and built-in command:  (for details checkout the [Project Setup](project-setup.md)).

    ```bash
    trueautomation init
    ```

   This way is the easiest. You can initialize a project from scratch. We generate a sample project for you or you can update your own exciting project.

* To initialize a project with tests [manually](project-init-manually.md).
