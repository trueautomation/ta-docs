# Initializing automatically

Follow the steps below to automatically initialize a project and start writing tests (if you prefer to manually initialize your project - please refer to [manual initialization](/initializing/initializing-manually.md) section).

1. Run the code below in your command line to start the initialization process (please refer to [Project Setup](/getting-started/project-setup.md) for details):

```bash
 mkdir my-project
 cd my-project
 trueautomation init
```
2. Enter your API key from your profile page at TrueAutomation.io account

3. Choose your technology stack

4. Select an existing project or create a new one

5. Run the sample test
    
This is the easiest way to get started. You can initialize a project from scratch (we generate a sample project for you) or you can update your own existing project.
