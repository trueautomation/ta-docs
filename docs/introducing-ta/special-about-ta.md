## What’s so special about TrueAutomation.io {docsify-ignore}

[TrueAutomation.io](https://trueautomation.io/) substitutes regular locator with unique element footprint that is generated by built-in AI engine.
<br>This unique footprint looks like a regular locator, works like a regular locator but is totally different inside - we call it a “smart locator”. Basically it is an alias with a human-readable name for a set of various unique attributes of an element. That’s why, even when the page changes dramatically, [TrueAutomation.io](https://trueautomation.io/) still finds the required element. Once the tested webpage changes,  regular locators used in test code often become invalid and there is no way to find an element, but in TrueAutomation we are looking at multiple values together and  thats’s why elements are still found.
