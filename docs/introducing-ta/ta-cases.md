## In what cases&nbsp;[TrueAutomation.io](https://trueautomation.io/) is a good fit: {docsify-ignore}

**Case 1. You need to set up testing automation on a project, written on Vaadin or GWT.**

If you use regular tools, it will be a very complicated and challenging task. As we all know, e.g. in Vaadin, ID of an element changes in real time, so there is no way to build a reliable locator - which means there will be no way to reliably automate tests.

However…

If you use TrueAutomation.io - it will take you literally 1 click on the element to add it’s ‘smart locator’ to you test code. And this element will still be found every time again and again.

**Case 2. You have tests automated, however they require maintenance every time you have a new release.**

Based on the info we’ve collected,  some teams spend up to 40% of their time on maintenance. If you use regular technologies, you will need to go to the website, find the element that should be used in your test, inspect it, find something you could tie to and add that unreadable value to your test code. So much hassle with no guarantee that it will not break after the next release.

If you use TrueAutomation.io - you would hardly ever need to maintain test. But just in case there is such a  rare situation it will take you literally 1 click on the element to update it’s ‘smart locator’ in your test code.
